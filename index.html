    <h1 class="bio">Steve Jobs Early Life</h1>
    <h4 class="para">
        Born in San Francisco, Jobs was adopted by an encouraging and loving family.
        He developed an interest in computers and engineering at a young age, inspired by his father’s 
        machinist job and love for electronics. Growing up south of Palo Alto, Jobs was bright beyond 
        comparison – his teachers wanted him to skip several grades and enter high school early, although 
        his parents declined. When he did go to high school, Jobs met his future business partner, 
        Steve Wozniak, with whom he bonded over their shared love for electronics and computer chips.</h4>

        Main article: Apple I
        Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the desktop computer,
        which led to the formation of Apple Computer in 1976. Both Jobs and Wozniak constructed several 
        of the Apple I prototypes by hand, funded by selling some of their belongings. Eventually, 200 
        units were produced.

        The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful 
        mass-produced microcomputer products,[87] designed primarily by Wozniak, and Jobs 
        oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case[250] and Rod Holt developed 
        the unique power supply.[85] It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire 
        by Jobs and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by Apple.

        iPhone
        Main article: iPhone
        Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007.
        The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware 
        of its release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year" for 2007 and included it in the All-TIME 100 
        Gadgets list in 2010, in the category of Communication.[271] The completed iPhone had multimedia capabilities 
        and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone.
